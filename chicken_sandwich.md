Chicken marinade:
 - Chicken thighs
 - Chinese chili oil sauce thing
 - Salt
 - Chili pepper flakes
 - Szechuan peppercorns
 
Coating:
 - Flour
 - Corn starch
 - Salt
 - Pepper

Marinade and coat, then fry in oil on medium/medium-high for 7-9 minutes (depending on size), flipping half-way. Serve with filling on a ciabatta.

Typical fillings I use:
 - Mayo
 - Ketchup
 - Red onions
 - Tomato
 - Lettuce
 - Cheese (not super sharp cheddar works)
