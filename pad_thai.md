## Pad Thai, serves 4

Notes:
 - Since home burners aren't exactly Super Hot, removing the protein allows the pan to heat up more without overcooking anything
 - Peanut butter and soy sauce isn't authentic, but to hell with authenticity
 - To achieve a sweeter taste similar to American Thai restaurants, add a spoon or two more of that brown sugar
 
## Recipe

### Sauce
 - 50g fish sauce
 - 60g brown sugar
 - 50g tamarind paste
 - *optional* 20g peanut butter
 - *optional* 20g soy sauce

Combine in a sauce pan and heat over medium heat until everything dissolves. Don't let the sauce thicken too much.

### Rice noodles
 - 300g rice noodles (or about 100g dry noodles soaked for 30 minutes)

Briefly heat/break up the noodles in hot water, around 3 minutes.

### Protein
 - 3-4 chicken thighs, depending on size
 - or 10-15 shrimps, perhaps TJ's Argentinian Red Shrimps
 - 2 lightly beaten eggs
 
Consider lightly dry brining the protein to improve flavor.
 
### Veggies and greens
 - handful of bean sprouts, a cup or so
 - *optional* small bunch of garlic chives, in 2-3cm pieces
 - *optional* small bunch of scallions, in 2-3 cm chunks
 
### Aromatics
 - 1 shallot or 1/2 red onion, sliced
 - *optional* 2 garlic cloves, chopped

Heat a tablespoon of avocado oil on high until it lightly smokes, then add the shallots/red onions and stir for 30 seconds. 
Add the protein of choice and cook until almost done, then push to the side. Add the beaten eggs to the other side of the pan.
Fold and break up the eggs, then set aside everything.

Lightly oil the pan again and heat oil on high heat, add garlic and stir until aromatic, around 20 seconds. Then add the veggies and lightly saute for 30 seconds.
Stir in the noodles, protein, and sauce. then toss until well-coated.

### To serve
