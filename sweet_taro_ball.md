## Sweet taro ball, serves \infty

Notes:
 - You can easily make double, triple recipe and freeze them in a freezer bag.
 - You can just eyeball the sauce; it's not a science.

### Taro balls
 - 200g taro
 - 200g purple sweet potates (okinawa)
 - 200g japanese sweet potatoes (satsumaimo or garnet)
 - 300g tapioca flour

Peel and cut the starchy roots, and steam for around 15 minutes or until fork tender.
In three separate mixing bowls, mash the taro and sweet potatoes.
Add 100g of tapioca flour to each bowl. Okinawa may be slightly drier and require a bit of water/less flour, and Satsumaimo a little more. 
YMMV and adjust until you have a clean bowl.

Roll and cut into small chunks, about 1.5cm each in length. At this point, you may freeze most of it in separate freezer bags, dusted lightly with tapioca flour.

### Boiling

In boiling water, add a combination of the three taro balls and wait for them to float up. After about a minute or two, drain and place in cold water.

### Sauce
 - 1/2 cup coconut milk
 - 1-2 tbsp condensed milk
 - *optional* 1 tbsp black/brown sugar

In a sauce pan, all the ingredients for the sauce and whist until well-combined. Substitute whole milk for coconut milk if you wish to enjoy cold.

### To serve
 - Kinako
 - [Anko](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-anko-red-bean-paste/)
