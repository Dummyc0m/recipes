Mango Sticky Rice, serves 3

Rice:
 - 1 cup short grain sweet rice
 - 1 to 5/4 cups water

Soak the sweet rice overnight, then cook in a rice cooker with water. Use the guides on the rice cooker pot if they exist.

Rice soak:
 - 1/2 cup coconut milk
 - 1 tbsp white sugar
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 
Add the rice soak to the sweet rice once it has finished cooking, and leave it on Keep Warm for at least 30 mintues.

Sauce:
 - 1 cup coconut milk
 - 3-4 tbsp white sugar depending on the mangoes
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 3/2 tbsp sweet rice flour
 
In a sauce pan, combine all the sauce ingredients. Take care to dissolve the sweet rice flour with a small amount of coconut milk to avoid clumping. 
Heat the sauce on medium to medium-high. Heat for around 3 minutes until it coats the back of a spoon.

To assemble, cut the mangoes into chunks or slices, serve with warm sweet rice and sauce.
